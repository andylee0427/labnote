nov. 12 - week 10 lab notes

challenge to interact of converging particulary interesting as soon as
you send emails with attachment, you change it into another version by
converging, you'll have difficult time, keeping track i did a model,
traditional model of taking document and put them in sequence you send
it to three people, three copies... that was one model, the traditional

everything you see.. you're also journaling, such as diary whatever you
did, you do journaling that's ledger... on the top of your work, you're
going to keep the journal that should be in your model

layers folders in project, things are changing normally you change
something... for example, you change in one file, then you're losing
original normally that's how you work unless you save different version,
it's difficult time you're losing that history to solve that problem,
you're going to add another layer called gib or journal

verion 1, version 2, where you add layers you do journal it forces you
to do journal
