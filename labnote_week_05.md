files are files, mostly you're working like this one file... it does not
have dependency when you install open office, firefox etc. that install
in many different places, and there are lot of files involved when you
start firefox, there's window ... firefox did not have pacakge inside..
not only are there many files...

when you open fiirefox, it's share many different programs, they look
the same there's no reason... imagine this problem,... Window icon
version one it also use same window icon, **FIREFOX **MS Word --\>
X --\> V1 V2

there are some folders that have components that is sharable install
MSW... rather than reconcile... every program is installing DLL - share
component for exmaple, the little X is describe somewhere
